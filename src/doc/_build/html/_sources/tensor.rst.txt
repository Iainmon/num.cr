Tensor objects

Bottle provides an N-dimensional array type, the `Tensor`, which describes a collection of "items" of the same
type. The items can be indexed using for
example N integers.

All Tensors are homogenous: every item takes up the same size
block of memory, and all blocks are interpreted in exactly the same
way. How each item in the array is to be interpreted is specified by a
separate data-type object, one of which is associated
with every tensor.

An item extracted from an array, *e.g.*, by indexing, is represented
by a Crystal object whose type is one of the scalar types used in Bottle. The array scalars allow easy manipulation
of also more complicated arrangements of data.
